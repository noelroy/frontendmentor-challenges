## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- rem unit : 1 rem unit = the font-size of the root component which is usually body tag.
- vh unit : represent 1% of the viewport height
- Using css variables
```css
:root {
  --bg-main: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
}

body {
  background-color: var(--bg-main);
}
```
- Importing font and using it
```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@300;400;600&display=swap");
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 300;
}

```

### Continued development

- Learn to position images better
- Learn to use position absolute and relative together to display elements on top of each other
- Learn to centre objects both horizontally and vertically

### Useful resources

- [Image Overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - This helped me for displaying image overlay for the main image on hover.
